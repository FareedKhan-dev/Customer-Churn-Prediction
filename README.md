Final Project for Machine Learning-I course is based on “Churn Prediction”. Churn is a phenomenon which occurs when the customers leave a particular brand or business i.e., they stop buying their products or services. In terms of Machine learning, our “Churn prediction” project will predict whether the customers will leave the business or not. 

The information obtained from this data will be helpful for the companies as they will look to retain their customers by analyzing which of them are at a high risk of leaving. 

The dataset we are using in this project is obtained from the telecom industry, and it contains 100,000 records with 100 attributes to be analyzed. The target variable “churn” will predict which customers will leave and which will not.
